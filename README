Reactor 3D Game Engine - Reiser Games

The Reactor 3D Game Engine was originally written with XNA/C# for cross-platform windows/xbox360 gaming.
Over 2 years worth of development has gone into it but I must say that it is lacking
in a few features here and there.  Overall it's enough to get anyone started using XNA
and developing for Windows and XBox 360.

A game called Alchemist was released on XBox Live Indy Games using this game engine.

I have since stopped doing XNA and DirectX in general and want to spend my spare time
working on learning OpenGL.  I've spent the better part of 8 years learning DirectX
but I believe now (with mobile platforms and Mac taking a bigger market share) is
a good time to switch.

The XNA Reactor Game Engine has been added for legacy purposes only.
No bug fixes or feature additions will be added.

The OpenGL Reactor Game Engine will try to keep to the same API structure as the XNA engine
but will have to deviate in areas where that functionality isn't implemented as such with OpenGL.

I do believe that the Core structure of the engine can and will remain the same.

So until this readme is updated... do not use the OGL project as it is untested.
